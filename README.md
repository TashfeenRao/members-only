# Members-Only
In this project, we built an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.


## Built With

- Ruby,
- Ruby On Rails,

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
- git clone git@github.com:trekab/members-only.git

Then you browse to the folder and exucute the following commands
- cd members-only
- bundle install

Thus run the migration
- rails db:seed
- rails db:migrate

Now, you can open the app in your text editor to check out the forms created and run 'rails s' to test the app.
